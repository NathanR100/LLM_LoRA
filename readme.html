# Call Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying customer support calls into
predefined categories using unstructured call transcripts.

The source data consists of raw, unstructured transcripts. Your primary
objectives are to parse these transcripts into a usable representation
and design a model (or pipeline) that can classify each call into the
specified categories.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem Tasks

1.  **Transcript Parsing**\
    The call data is unstructured; you must parse each transcript into a
    structured form suitable for modeling (e.g., tokenized text,
    features, or embeddings).

2.  **Model / System Design**\
    Develop or design a model that can categorize calls into the given
    categories. Depending on your chosen approach, you may:

    -   Implement a working classification model (possibly using
        pre-trained NLP models), or\
    -   Provide a clear system/architecture diagram that shows how you
        would perform the classification end-to-end.

    **Notes:**

    -   A full, from-scratch model training and data labeling effort is
        **not** required.\
    -   You are encouraged to use pre-trained models, existing NLP
        libraries, or other high-level methods to demonstrate a viable
        solution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output / Deliverables

1.  **One of the following:**
    -   **Model:**\
        A running model that performs the call classification task (it
        may be pre-trained). Include enough instructions/code for
        someone to run it end-to-end on the provided data.\
    -   **Diagram:**\
        A diagram describing how the model/system can be designed from
        start to end. This should clearly show data flow, preprocessing
        steps, modeling components, and outputs.
        -   You may use any diagramming format (e.g., PowerPoint,
            draw.io, Visio, Canva, etc.).\
        -   Ensure the image is shared with your submission, either as
            its own file (e.g., included in a PPT) or embedded in the
            notebook.
2.  **Presentation (PPT)**
    -   A slide deck of up to **5 pages** summarizing:
        -   Your overall approach.
        -   Modeling or system design decisions.
        -   Any experiments or illustrative examples.
        -   Key results or expected outcomes.
3.  **Notebook Submission**
    -   Submit the notebook `call_classifier.ipynb` containing:
        -   Your exploratory work (if any).
        -   Parsing / preprocessing code.
        -   Model code or pseudo-code / illustrative examples.
    -   Make sure all relevant cells have been executed and outputs are
        visible.

## Notes on Exporting / Sharing

Ensure that all outputs are saved in the notebook before exporting. You
can export your notebook as HTML via Jupyter's "File → Download as →
HTML" or similar workflow.
